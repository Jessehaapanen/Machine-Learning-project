# Machine-learning-project

This project was done in Machine Learning -course in university. The aim of this 
program was to predict number of deaths at Uusimaa with help of weather data. I tried two different
machine learning methods to find out better way to predict number of deaths. My program makes visualizations of data given, calculates training and validating errors using K-Foold method and makes visualization of those. After this program prepares linear and polynomic regressions,
calculates testing error for both of these models and plots the errors so that user can make decision which method is more suitable for this specific machine learning problem.

I used PythonÂ´s Numpy and Pandas libraries because they are most used in Python to handle data and create machine learning program. In addition, I used Sklearn library to prepare regression and Matplotlib to plot my data and results. These libraries and technologies were also used throughout the course.
